# Pizza Sales Analysis:

This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to identify top-selling pizzas, revenue trends, and customer preferences. The dataset includes orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types, providing insights into sales performance.

Key analyses include identifying the top 3 pizzas per category based on revenue, determining the most ordered pizzas by quantity, and evaluating daily sales trends. Additionally, assessing pizza category profitability helps optimize the menu and marketing strategies.

Findings suggest focusing on high-revenue pizzas, aligning inventory with demand, offering promotions on slow sales days, and introducing seasonal variations. This SQL-driven approach enables data-driven decisions to boost sales and improve business efficiency.
